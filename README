Dont use it.

Now that you know what not to do, heres how its done:

Boot grml
Get network connectivity
Clone the repo
Remove network connectivity
sudo echo "84.240.3.129 irc.freenode.net" >> /etc/hosts
./start_server
Follow on-screen instructions for time magics
./generate_master to generate the user scripts from skript.txt and the nicks file
./clientify to run the magic
